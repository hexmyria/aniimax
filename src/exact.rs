//! Exact planner: finds the provably best plan as one mixed-integer program over the whole
//! production network, instead of a continuous solve followed by rounding and heuristic passes.
//!
//! ## Model
//! - Every available recipe `r` gets a rate `b_r` (batches/sec) and a whole number of units
//!   `u_r` set to it (plots for a crop, machines for a processed item): `b_r * t_r <= u_r`, where
//!   `t_r` is the recipe's time per batch. A unit makes one thing and is left running, so units
//!   are never shared between recipes. The exception is level-up materials (see [`takes_turns`]):
//!   one Woodworking Bench has to make each tier in turn, so its recipes share its time.
//! - Every item balances: what's made covers what recipes use plus what's sold. A quick variant
//!   (e.g. `quick_wheat`) makes the same item as the regular one (`wheat`).
//! - Each facility's units per recipe add up to at most what's owned, counting only units at a
//!   high enough level for each recipe.
//! - A crop that needs a growing environment needs its plots covered: each environment building
//!   runs one mode and one coverage mix (see [`crate::coverage::single_building_options`]).
//! - Woodland and Mine byproducts (Wood Blocks, Mineral Sand) balance like any other item, so the
//!   Woodworking Bench and Chimney Kiln can use them.
//! - During a season, its items also earn points when sold, which a priority or floor can name
//!   as [`crate::models::SEASON_POINTS`]. Season seeds cost the season currency, which plans treat
//!   as unlimited (see [`crate::models::SeasonTerms`]).
//! - The objective is the target currency per second from everything sold; for coins, minus seed
//!   costs (seeds are paid in coins, so they don't come off an Aniimo EXP total). A floor can
//!   name another currency, so a plan keeps up the Aniimo EXP or Aniipods an earlier solve found
//!   while earning as many coins as that leaves room for. For an RV level-up
//!   ([`Goal::LevelUp`]) it's the pace instead: level-ups per day, where making the coins and
//!   items it costs, on top of what's already in stock, takes a day per level-up. Stock enters each
//!   balance as `pace * stock`, and the cost as `-pace * cost`, which keeps the model linear.
//!
//! ## Search
//! Branch and bound over the whole-unit variables, with each node's continuous relaxation solved
//! from scratch by `microlp` (its own integer search isn't robust enough here). Nodes are explored
//! best bound first; a node whose relaxation can't beat the best plan found so far is dropped. When
//! the search runs out of nodes the plan is proven optimal; if it hits the time limit, the best
//! open bound says how far from optimal it could be.
