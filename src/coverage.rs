//! Exact 2D geometric packing for environment-building coverage (Heat Furnace/Cooling Unit/
//! Sunlamp).
//!
//! ## Coverage geometry
//! - A Cooling Unit is a 2x2 footprint; a Heat Furnace and a Sunlamp sit on one tile
//!   ([`ENVIRONMENT_BUILDING_SIZES`]). All three cover the same 9x9, so the smaller ones'
//!   squares land on tile lines while the Cooling Unit's sits half a tile off.
//! - It radiates coverage as a square of side `2 * `[`COVERAGE_RADIUS`] centered on its own exact
//!   center (not its corner).
//! - A facility is covered only if its own footprint overlaps that coverage square by a real
//!   area; a corner-only touch is not enough. Since every footprint snaps to quarter tiles
//!   ([`GRID_STEP`]), any nonzero overlap between two quarter-tile-aligned rectangles is
//!   automatically at least 0.25x0.25, so this rule falls out for free from only ever generating
//!   candidate positions on that grid; no separate minimum-area check is needed.
//! - Facilities can't overlap the building itself or each other.
//! - Facility footprints: Farmland/Dewy House 2x2, Woodland 4x4, Starfall Hammock/Tidewhisper
//!   Sandcastle/Floral Windmill 5x5; see [`ENVIRONMENT_GATED_FACILITIES`].
//!
//! ## Candidate generation is a bounded heuristic, not exhaustive
//!
//! Sweeping every quarter-tile position for every facility type would generate thousands of
//! candidates per type; intractable for the MILP branch & bound this feeds into (see
//! `crate::optimizer::solve_facility_allocation`). Instead, [`candidate_positions`] finds the
//! single best quarter-tile alignment for each facility type on its own, plus a handful of
//! half-space variants (restricting that same search to one half of the region, split through the
//! building's center) so the ILP has enough raw material to reconstruct mixed layouts when two or
//! more types share one building's coverage. Candidate **generation** is this bounded, tuned
//! subset; candidate **selection** among them (which is what actually decides how many of each
//! type get used) is exact integer optimization.

/// Solves environment-building coverage for ONE building type's `owned` units, jointly across ALL

/// at least one candidate item, where `weight` is that combo's own per-plot value; independent of
/// any solved item rate (see below for why). `facility_owned` is how many of each facility type
/// the player actually owns (shared across every mode, since a physical plot can only serve one
/// mode's crop at a time).
///
/// Assigns the `owned` buildings ONE AT A TIME: for each, tries every active mode's best possible
/// single-building layout (see [`solve_one_building_layout`]) against whatever facility capacity
/// is still unclaimed, keeps whichever mode scores highest for that specific building, and
/// deducts its usage before moving to the next building. Two alternative designs were ruled out:
/// 1. One combined MILP mixing this packing with the continuous item-rate LP
///    (`crate::optimizer::solve_facility_allocation`); hangs even at modest scale (~50 continuous
///    plus ~120 integer variables).
/// 2. A single joint ILP across all `owned` buildings at once (one variable per candidate
///    placement bounded `[0, owned]`, plus a shared facility-ownership-cap constraint); still
///    hangs once fully decoupled from the item-rate LP, whenever the ownership cap is tight
///    relative to what geometry alone could pack. This is a classic NP-hard packing+knapsack
///    branch-and-bound cliff, not a gradual slowdown: a looser cap stays fast at the same `owned`.
///
/// Solving one binary-variable, capacity-1 building at a time sidesteps that cliff entirely: each
/// individual solve has no ownership trade-off encoded in the ILP (exhausted types are simply
/// excluded from the candidate set), so every one of the `owned` solves stays in the same fast,
/// well-behaved regime as a lone building. The cost is trading true joint optimality (across
/// buildings AND modes AND facility types simultaneously) for a sequential greedy approximation,
/// the same kind of accepted trade `find_production_plan`'s own stranded-chain exclusion loop
/// already makes elsewhere in this codebase, and unavoidable here since the exact joint problem is
/// genuinely intractable at realistic scale.
///
/// Returns `(mode_counts, placements, layouts)`:

/// - `layouts` keyed by `mode`; one entry per building instance assigned to that mode, each a
